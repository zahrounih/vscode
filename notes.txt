Notes regarding sorting events mimatches:

EBS events:
Early bags distribution across EBS lanes varies over time and reproducing the exact same load distribution schema is almost impossible.

PS1POS2TRF:
ABISv2 Fabricom topology is still not aligned with ABISv1 version

Routes load-balacing:
Regardless of the platform version, Fabricom LSS has to balance bags flows loads when 2 or more routes are provided (i.e: From TA to EBS).

BLH2 and BTH2:
Due to separate configuration tables in ABISv1 and v2, overurles were mistakenly not aligned.

Chute allocation load-balancing:
US flight(TU7xxx)local bags load is spread over chute 32 and 33.
